<p>I am a manual QA who has a little knowledge of automation and wants to improve in this area. </p>
<p>I don’t know much about all the tools yet, but I do have some experience in automation, mainly focused on scripting. </p>
<p>I’ve used Selenium with Java, including a hybrid Selenium framework where test data is updated through Excel sheets, as well as BDD using SpecFlow, and other tools. </p>
<p>I’ve also used Visual Studio, VS Code, and Eclipse for Java. </p>
<p>This time, I want to try Playwright using TypeScript. </p>
<p>I’m not very knowledgeable in JavaScript, but I chose TypeScript for Playwright. </p>
<p>I also want to try Antigravity to help me with my automation since I’m still improving my automation skills.</p>
