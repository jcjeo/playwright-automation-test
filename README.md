I am a manual QA who has a little knowledge of automation and wants to improve in this area. 
I don’t know much about all the tools yet, but I do have some experience in automation, mainly focused on scripting. 
I’ve used Selenium with Java, including a hybrid Selenium framework where test data is updated through Excel sheets, as well as BDD using SpecFlow, and other tools.
I’ve also used Visual Studio, VS Code, and Eclipse for Java. 
This time, I want to try Playwright using TypeScript. 
I’m not very knowledgeable in JavaScript, but I chose TypeScript for Playwright. 
I also want to try Antigravity to help me with my automation since I’m still improving my automation skills.
